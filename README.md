# Mapping_Earthquakes
 
This is an interactive map built with Leaflet and using maps from Mapbox. The final code resides within the Earthquake_Challenge folder in the main branch. The map visualizes USGS data for earthquakes from the last seven days, with options to view quakes below and above magnitude 4.5, as well as lines representing the borders of tectonic plates.

Note: The assignment did not ask this, but the layer which originally included all earthquakes now only shows those up to 4.5 magnitude. I think this makes it look a bit nicer.
